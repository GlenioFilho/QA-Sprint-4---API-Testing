QA Sprint 4 - API Testing

🛠️ Project Description
In Sprint 4, the focus was on API testing. During this sprint, we learned from the basics of APIs to advanced techniques for testing APIs using tools like Postman. The main goal was to make sure the application's API is working correctly through positive tests (valid behavior) and negative tests (error handling).

APIs are an important part of communication between systems. Testing them properly ensures that data flow and system functions work smoothly without issues.

🎯 Objective
The goal of this sprint was to:

Understand the basic concepts of an API.

Test APIs using Postman.

Design and run API tests to check responses, authentication, and error handling.

Use Swagger and Apidoc for API documentation.

Create both automated and manual tests to ensure the API works well.

🚀 Tools Used

Postman: Used for testing the API manually and automatically.

Swagger: Used to view and document APIs.

Apidoc: Used to generate interactive API documentation.

cURL: Used to test API requests directly from the terminal.

📝 Key Tasks and Workflow

Introduction to APIs:

Learn what an API is and how it works.

Understand API architecture, especially REST.

Learn about HTTP requests and responses, including the JSON format.

API Testing with Postman:

Perform basic tests using Postman: Send requests to different API endpoints and validate the responses.

Create dynamic URLs and test with cURL.

Test integration between the database and API to ensure data consistency.

Check API logs for errors and performance issues.

Create bug reports for any issues found during tests.

Designing Tests for API:

Create positive and negative tests to check valid and invalid API behavior.

Use techniques like equivalence classes and boundary values to improve test coverage.

Validate API responses to make sure the data returned is correct.

Create an API test checklist to ensure all cases are tested.

Sprint 4 Project:

Work on a practical project to test an API, using everything learned during the sprint.

Follow a task checklist to make sure all project steps are completed.

Deliver the final project with complete documentation and tests.
